# google-inbox-pause
Since Adios.ai is nog working anymore I wanted to start an google-script alternative to pause your inbox, to only receive mails based on time I choose.


Useage: 

- Create a filter in your gmail to cath ALL incoming mails. (I use the *-search). Then Choose SKIPINBOX/ARCHIVE, MARK-AS-READ, APPLY (new) LABEL: "inboxpause"
- Go to https://script.google.com and add the inboxpause.gs
- Run createTimeDrivenTriggers()
